    "- **Count**: Both `Unit` and `Sales` have 7560 entries, meaning there are no missing values in these columns.\n",
    "- **Mean and Distribution**: The average (`mean`) value for both `Unit` and `Sales` is `0.254`. With a standard deviation of `0.2048`, the data is moderately spread around the mean. The values range from `0.0` to `1.0`, suggesting that the data might be normalized or scaled.\n",
    "- **Quartiles**: Most of the data lies between `0.095` (25th percentile) and `0.381` (75th percentile), showing a right-skewed distribution with lower values being more frequent.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Data Summary\n",
    "- **Date**: The dataset spans 90 unique dates, with `1-Oct-2020` appearing most frequently (84 times). This might indicate a significant event or peak activity on this date.\n",
    "- **Time**: There are three time categories, with `Morning` being the most common (2520 entries). This suggests that most activities occurred during the morning hours.\n",
    "- **State**: Seven states are represented, with `WA` being the most frequent (1080 entries). This could indicate that the dataset is focused on or has a bias toward activity in Washington.\n",
    "- **Group**: Four groups are present, and `Kids` is the largest category (1890 entries), suggesting a focus or higher participation from the \"Kids\" group.\n",

    "#### Insights\n",
    "1. **Numerical Data**: The similarity in the statistics for `Unit` and `Sales` implies a potential relationship between the two columns. The distribution indicates that lower values are more common, with occasional higher values pushing the max to `1.0`.\n",
    "2. **Categorical Data**:\n",
    "   - The dominance of `Morning`, `WA`, and the `Kids` group might highlight specific trends or patterns in the dataset.\n",
    "   - The frequent occurrence of `1-Oct-2020` might require further investigation to understand what caused this spike.\n"

    "### Final Analysis Report with Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **State-wise Sales Analysis for Different Demographic Groups (Kids, Men, Women, Seniors)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "This bar chart provides a state-wise breakdown of total sales across various demographic groups: Kids, Men, Women, and Seniors. It shows the contribution of each demographic group to the total sales in different states such as Victoria (VIC), New South Wales (NSW), Northern Territory (NT), Tasmania (TAS), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), and Western Australia (WA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Victoria (VIC)** leads in total sales across all demographics, followed by **New South Wales (NSW)**.\n",
    "- **Northern Territory (NT)** and **Tasmania (TAS)** have the lowest total sales figures.\n",
    "- **Kids** and **Men** are the dominant demographic groups contributing to sales, while **Seniors** and **Women** have relatively smaller contributions across all states.\n",
    "- States like **VIC** and **NSW** contribute significantly to sales, while **NT** and **TAS** show weaker performance, indicating a potential area for sales growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Focus on Growth in NT and TAS:** Given the lower sales in NT and TAS, targeted sales programs focusing on these regions could help boost revenue. Specific promotions or localized marketing strategies might increase engagement with these regions.\n",
    "- **Boost Female and Senior Sales:** While Men and Kids are strong performers, there is potential to increase the contribution of Women and Seniors. Special offers or tailored product lines for these groups could help increase sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Group-wise Sales Analysis Across Various States (Kids, Men, Seniors, Women)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "This grouped bar chart shows sales by demographic groups (Kids, Men, Women, Seniors) across different states. The height of each bar represents the total sales of each demographic, while the color within each bar represents the contribution of different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Kids** and **Men** consistently show the highest sales figures across all states, with **VIC** contributing the largest share in every group.\n",
    "- **NT** and **TAS** contribute the least across all groups, confirming the trend observed in the state-wise analysis.\n",
    "- The **Seniors** and **Women** groups, while showing moderate sales, could benefit from targeted strategies to increase engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **State-Specific Strategies for Demographic Groups:** Given that VIC contributes the most in every demographic group, more localized campaigns tailored to specific states, especially NT and TAS, could potentially improve the performance of those regions.\n",
    "- **Explore Product Expansion for Women and Seniors:** Launching targeted campaigns or product lines aimed at **Women** and **Seniors** could help tap into these underperforming demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Time-of-the-Day Sales Analysis (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "This line plot illustrates the total sales distribution over different times of the day: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. It shows that sales peak in the **Morning** and **Afternoon**, with a noticeable dip during the **Evening**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- The **Morning** and **Afternoon** are the peak sales periods, while the **Evening** sees a noticeable drop in sales.\n",
    "- This pattern indicates that customer activity tends to decrease in the evening, possibly due to other factors like time of day or availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Leverage Peak Sales Hours for Promotions:** Since the Morning and Afternoon have higher sales, sales campaigns or promotions should be concentrated during these periods to maximize revenue.\n",
    "- **Evening Promotions or Offers:** Consider introducing targeted promotions in the Evening to try and stimulate sales, such as discounts or limited-time offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Daily Sales Trend (October 2020 to January 2021)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "This line plot displays the daily sales trend, showing fluctuations over time. Initially, sales are relatively stable around 4 million but experience a sharp drop in early November. After the drop, sales stabilize around 3.5 million and show a strong upward trend in early December.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Sharp Drop in November:** The drop in early November could indicate an anomaly or a seasonal dip in sales.\n",
    "- **Recovery in December:** Sales recover towards the end of November and peak in early December, indicating a rebound or the impact of holiday-related sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Analyze November Dip:** Investigate the cause of the November sales dip. Was it due to market conditions, external events, or internal factors? Understanding this could help avoid future dips.\n",
    "- **Capitalize on the December Surge:** Given the sharp recovery in December, capitalizing on this trend with strategic promotions or stock management can further boost sales during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Weekly Sales Trend (October 2020 to January 2021)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "The weekly sales trend shows fluctuations with sales peaking at over 2.5 million by mid-October. A slight decline follows in early November, with a surge in December and a sharp drop at the end of the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Sales Surge in December:** December shows the highest peak in weekly sales, aligning with typical holiday season peaks.\n",
    "- **Fluctuations in October and November:** Sales stabilize and dip between October and November, showing less consistency before the year-end surge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Prepare for Seasonal Peaks:** Use insights from December's sales surge to plan for future holiday seasons, ensuring sufficient stock and targeted marketing.\n",
    "- **Manage Early November Slump:** Strategies like promotions or product launches could help counteract the decline in early November, smoothing the sales curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Monthly Sales Trend (October 2020 to January 2021)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Description:**  \n",
    "This monthly trend graph shows sales starting at around 1.1 billion in early November, dipping to about 900 million by the end of November, and then steadily rising to 1.35 billion by the end of December.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **November Dip:** A noticeable dip in November is followed by a steady rise in December, peaking at 1.35 billion.\n",
    "- **Strong Recovery in December:** The recovery and growth in December indicate that the company successfully capitalized on the end-of-year sales period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Boost November Sales:** Address the November dip with special offers, early holiday promotions, or campaigns targeting key demographics.\n",
    "- **Capitalize on December:** The end-of-year period can be a major revenue generator. Plan early to optimize stock, pricing, and marketing efforts during this peak time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion & Final Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State-Specific Growth Initiatives:** Focus on boosting sales in underperforming states (NT and TAS) through localized campaigns or product introductions aimed at specific demographic groups.\n",
    "- **Tailored Demographic Campaigns:** Women's and Seniors' segments show potential for growth. Develop tailored offerings and promotions to increase sales in these underperforming groups.\n",
    "- **Optimize Sales Periods:** Use the peak sales times (Morning and Afternoon) to maximize revenue through promotions. Consider strategies for evening sales to reduce the current dip.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Planning:** Prepare for seasonal trends, particularly focusing on December’s sales surge while managing the November dip. Anticipate similar trends for future years and plan marketing strategies accordingly.\n"
